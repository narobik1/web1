            Many people ask us how we are, how we can help animals.
            Thank you, Arun the elephant big brother, Cunama the giant otter and Lone the adolescent orangutan girl are doing well, along with the rest of the Zoo's residents. But all of them have new cubs in their families, and they're happy to accept your donation, which will go to the Zoo Foundation.

            If you would like to help us, you can do so by supporting the Zoo Foundation. Many little ones go a long way...

        <p>What to know about adoption</p>
        <p>General conditions for adoption:</p>
        <p>- Adoption is symbolic! The adopted animal stays in the zoo and is the property of the Budapest Zoo.</p>
        <p>- The minimum amount of the adoption is 10.000 HUF, the payment of which entitles the foster parent to 1 year membership. After the payment of the grant, the foster parent receives a certificate with the name of the adopted animal, a biography with the details of the adopted animal, a photo of the adopted animal, a badge and a card with free admission to the Spring and Autumn Foster Parents&apos; Meeting.</p>
        <p>- One animal can have more than one foster parent.</p>
        <p>- The fastest way to arrange an adoption is in person. We are open every day of the year, the same as the Zoo. The adoption certificate will be prepared immediately and the procedure will take no more than 10 minutes. You will find our office to the right of the Zoo&apos;s main entrance, by the Zoo Gift Shop.</p>
        <p>- The foster parent has no obligations towards the adopted animal and the same rights as other ordinary zoo visitors, e.g. you cannot go in to see the adopted tiger, kangaroo or elephant, only the animals that other visitors can go in to (e.g. petting animals).</p>
        <p>- Twice a year we organise the Zoo Foster Parents&apos; Meeting. For this event, each adopter receives a foster parent card that gives them free admission to the Zoo at the Spring and Fall Foster Parent Meetings and informs them about what the Zoo Foundation is donating to. &nbsp;At the event, you can meet your pet&apos;s carer at a &apos;parent meeting&apos;, who will tell you all about your adopted animal&apos;s well-being and habits. The exact dates of the Foster Parent Meeting are printed on the back of the card you receive when you adopt your pet.</p>
        <p>- The money paid will not be used by the Budapest Zoo exclusively for the adopted animal, but will be put into a common &quot;hat&quot; and used to cover the costs in line with the Foundation&apos;s objectives (mainly to improve the animals&apos; living conditions, purchase medicines, health care)</p>
        <p>On-line adoption - around the clock</p>
        <p>At the request of many people, you can now adopt your pet online, thus helping to improve the living conditions and health of the animals in the zoo!</p>
